### Supervised Learning

All the code is contained in the respective folder for each dataset.

There are two folders:

- Dataset 1 (Adult)
- Dataset 2 (Digits)

*Note:* There is a separate script for each algorithm.

## PROGRAMING LANGUAGE AND DEPENDENCIES

Make sure to have the following libraries installed. If not, you can install using ```pip install <library name>```

### Libraries used:
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- pandas
- numpy

## HOW TO RUN

To run the code type in the command line:

```python <filename>.py```

## ABOUT THE DATASET FILES

The dataset is contained in the folder for each algorithm.

## ABOUT PLOTS

Additionally each folder includes a folder with plots generated for analysis. There are some additional
plots which are not in the report, which are incremental steps done while tuning hyperparameters. The best
and final learning curves have been presented in the report.
